Simulation
--------------
Make code for selecting a given node

DQN Model 
-----------
Figure out how to pass input data (location of nodes, selected node, location and size of barrier arcs)
Figure out how to integrate control of coeffecients and transmit power
Figure out how to pass results (gain at selected node, gain at other nodes, total power used) back to agent
Figure out how to calculate reward - see DQNAgent.m for psuedocode
